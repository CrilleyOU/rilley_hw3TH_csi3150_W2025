            Marquette is a terrific tourist destination for those looking to get
            away from civilization, without abandoning it all together. Located
            within the thick forested Upper Peninsula, Marquette is an isolated
            community of roughly 20,000 living along the shores of Lake
            Superior. Due to its location, it is surrounded by beautiful natural
            waterfalls, rock formations, and hardwood forests.

            Regardless of the season, we offer a wonderful way to experience the
            beauty of Marquette both on land and in water. Your tour begins at
            the base of Sugarloaf Mountain, where depending on the season, you
            will have an appropriate mode of transportation to get to the top
            and take in the surrounding areas. After this we travel down the
            mountain and board a boat waiting for us to take in Marquette from
            Lake Superior.
          </p>
          <h3>What to Wear</h3>
          <p>
            For summer tours, it is recommended that you wear very light,
            long-sleeved clothing. Marquette's location deep within the
            northwoods includes lots of black flies and gnats with it. Your tour
            will provide gloves and masks to wear if your trip is occurring
            during peak black fly season. For other tours, just dress
            comfortably for the temperature. Typically it is pretty cool outside
            of the summers but keep your eye on the forecast.
          </p>

        "The tours provided by Marquette Tour and Travel are some of the best
        ways to take in Marquette. My family and I had a terrific time taking in
        the views of Presque Isle from the boat after getting a birds eye view
        of the city from the top of Sugarloaf Mountain. Would recommend their
        tour to anyone visiting the area."
